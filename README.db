I obviously want to use a database.
I'd love to learn how to use a mapreduce db (hadoop, couchdb), but
  the drawback is that google app engine doesn't support mapreduce...

couchdb has:
   - document database (not relational -- no join operator)
   - distributed
   - map/reduce
   - cached queries (map/reduce via views)
   - ACID, MVCC
   - code distributed as javascript

google app engine datastore
   - hard to build summaries after the fact (hard to maintain them too...)

Three levels would be ideal:
   - laptop         ("sqlite")
   - free cloud     (google app engine)
   - self managed   (couchdb)
